# Web-Based Piano

<b> This project is inspired by an idea that can be found widely across the internet. I simply recreated the concept and made some modifications to suit my own approach.

این پروژه از ایده‌ای الهام گرفته شده که به‌طور گسترده‌ای در سراسر اینترنت یافت می‌شود. من تنها این کانسپت را دوباره پیاده‌سازی کرده و تغییراتی به دلخواه خود اعمال کردم.

## Overview

This project is a web-based piano application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to play piano sounds using their keyboard keys. The piano keys are visually represented and mapped to specific key codes, and each key press produces a corresponding sound.

## Features

### Key Features
- **Keyboard Interaction**: Play piano notes using your computer keyboard. Each key on the keyboard is mapped to a specific piano note.
- **Visual Feedback**: When a key is pressed, it visually highlights the key on the piano and shows the note currently being played.
- **Sound Playback**: Each key press triggers a sound corresponding to the piano note, using pre-recorded audio files.
- **Transition Effects**: Keys have smooth CSS transition effects that are visually appealing when keys are pressed and released.
- **Hint Labels**: Each piano key has a hint label that displays the corresponding key letter on the screen.

### Supported Keys
- The piano keys are mapped to standard keys on the keyboard:
  - `A` -> C
  - `W` -> C#
  - `S` -> D
  - `E` -> D#
  - `D` -> E
  - `F` -> F
  - `T` -> F#
  - `G` -> G
  - `Y` -> G#
  - `H` -> A
  - `U` -> A#
  - `J` -> B
